        In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms,
        our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our
        docks, our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and
        other places too numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats
        oft set them at defiance; still they are of great service.

        How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress
        from their place of refuge or that which is their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles,
        Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!

      <p>
        A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat
        has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and
        let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind
        regard for them.
